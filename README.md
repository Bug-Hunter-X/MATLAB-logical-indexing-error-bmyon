# MATLAB Logical Indexing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB related to logical indexing when dealing with arrays containing mixed data types. The error can lead to unexpected results and is often difficult to debug.

## Bug Description
The `bug.m` file contains a MATLAB function that uses logical indexing. However, due to a subtle issue with data types within the array being indexed, the logical indexing does not produce the expected outcome.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the data type issues in the logical indexing operation, leading to the correct results.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `bug.m` and run the code. Observe the unexpected output.
3.  Open `bugSolution.m` and run the code. Observe the corrected output. 

## Learning Points
This example highlights the importance of carefully checking data types in your MATLAB arrays, especially when using logical indexing.  Unexpected data types can lead to silent errors that are challenging to find. Ensuring type consistency through explicit type casting or data validation techniques is essential for robust and error-free MATLAB code.
